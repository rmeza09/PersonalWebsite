# My personal porfolio website!
A user friendly web app I use to display some of the cool events in my engineering career and the highlight projects I have worked on. I used this app to practice some front end development teaching myself the React framework with javascript and vanilla css. Here I was able to learn to make some components for organizing content: page navigation, image carousels, file download buttons, link buttons. Also learning to deploy the a site to production with a serverless solution, Vercel. The vercel solution allowed me to integrate site analytics and continous production updates through Git.
