# My personal porfolio website!
A user friendly web app I use to display some of the cool events in my engineering career and the highlight projects I have worked on. I used this app to practice some front end development teaching myself the React framework with javascript and vanilla css. Here I was able to learn to make some components for organizing content: page navigation, image carousels, file download buttons, link buttons. Also learning to deploy the a site to production with a serverless solution, Vercel.

## 🧰 Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) – JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Vanilla CSS – Handwritten CSS for custom styling
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) – Module bundler used for development and production builds
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) – JavaScript compiler to use ES6+ features
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) – For managing dependencies and scripts
