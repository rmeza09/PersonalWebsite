          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hi, my name is Rafael Santiago Meza, and I am a mechanical engineer with a strong background in sensor technology, aerospace applications, and numerical analysis. I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Maryland (UMD), College Park.            
          </p>
          <p>I am seeking my first full-time role post-graduation in December 2025. I am excited to join a company that aligns with my ambitions and provides a community where I can grow both professionally and personally.</p>
          <p>Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you can learn about my journey and projects.</p>

          <h2>Portland, Oregon - 2024</h2>
          <p>In November 2024, I had the incredible opportunity to attend and present a poster on my research at the ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress in Portland, Oregon. Over three enriching days, I learned about state-of-the-art research, connected with fellow engineers, and engaged in discussions on the future of fiber optic health monitoring systems for structural state evaluation.</p>
