          <p className="project-description">
          During my eight-month internship, I worked on Cryo Dyno, a cryogenic dynamometer. A dynamometer is a device used to measure the torque and power of a rotating assembly. I developed this robotic actuator test stand from problem definition in May, to manufacturing in August, and technical documentation in November. The goal was to create a test environment capable of stressing an actuator/motor under heavy cross-moment loading around the output shaft while operating in extreme temperatures.

          The cryogenic chamber chosen for this project can reach -184 degrees Celsius. The cross moment loading mechanism I designed can deliver 388Nm. The final assembly met targeted performance within 3% of the established goals. Beyond the CAD work, I supported design with FEA analysis for structural and temperature validation. Also, confirming CNC and water-jet manufacturability through Proto Labs. GD&T was implemented to maintain shaft alignments, communicate machining tolerances, and create dowel alignment features. Key challenges included bearing selections, bolted joint analysis, insulation design, and earthquake safety.

          <p className="project-description">
          In this project I built a 5kHz scanning system for working with the Hyperion SI155 optical sensing instrument. The Luna Innovations Python API, for communicating with the SI155, is used to call for the peak wavelengths and intensity measurements of an array of FBG sensors. I set up a LAN connection to the instrument using TCP/IP protocol with a static IP address and a subnet mask configuration. The PyQt6 front-end application controls the experimental setup, graphs live data and writes to an HDF5 file sampling at 10kHz.

          The motivation for this project was to create a tool that can be deployed on a PC to interface with the SI155 sensing instrument giving you access to file handling tools, like immediate conversion to CSV. The current hardware uses an array of 5 FBG sensors to sample vibration and temperature effects on a stainless-steel structure surface. The codebase employs object-oriented programming and concurrent processing with PyQt threading to manage both front-end and back-end tasks efficiently.

          <p className="project-description">
          In this project I developed a handheld temperature control device to support sensor experiments. I wrote and tuned a PID controller for feedback temperature control using a J-type thermocouple with an MCP9600 amplifier board. This is a N-channel MOSFET circuit powered by a 25 V power supply, controlled through PWM with an Arduino Nano Every. Using a rotatory encoder for user input to manually tune PID parameters and set target temperatures, displaying system data on two OLED screens through i2c protocol.

          The motivation for this project was to add a flexible heating element to a thin panel surface, which can be excited with an impact hammer to simultaneously measure vibration and temperature effects using FBG sensors. In lieu of having access to a Mach 6 tunnel before traveling to NASA Langley, I designed an analogous system which I can track through a single point vibrometer and the sensor network. The final goal is to test the measurement decoupling algorithm for sensor data processing.

              HERMES (Heavy Equipment Rover for lunar Mobility Expansion, and Sustainability) was designed as part of our Capstone senior design project sponsored by NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. My team and I worked to create a prototype which ultimately delivered the ability to lift 314lbs of cargo with a chassis weight of 104lbs. As part of this team I lead the vehicle design process and conducted the structural finite element analysis. As a team we addressed mechatronics and vehicle design challenges to deliver the final prototype.

          <p className="project-description">
          This project aimed to develop a target setpoint controller for a 4-rotor drone, leveraging a physics-informed control system to regulate its movement. The drone's dynamics were modeled using a state-space representation, capturing translational and rotational motion across three dimensions. A pole placement method was employed to design a stabilizing feedback controller, ensuring the drone could track desired positions and orientations effectively. Both animations display scenarios where an initial disturbance affects the flight trajectory chosen toward the targeted endpoint of x=0, y=0, z=0.           </p>

          The primary motivation was to design a precise and robust control system that could actuate the drone efficiently using physics-based insights. The results confirmed that the controller successfully stabilized the drone, achieving smooth transitions toward desired states. The project reinforced key control theory concepts, including state feedback, pole placement, and system modeling, providing valuable insights for real-world UAV stabilization.          </p>

          In this project I designed a solid-state rocket test bed as part of a mock research proposal to justify budgetary spending for research into solid state propellant erosion, within the combustion chamber of the rocket and how a variety of factors affect the erosion rate. The objective of this proposal was to produce a testing apparatus for a solid-state propellant model rocket body. The erosion rate is directly correlated to the burning rate of the propellant and thus the thrust produced by the model rocket. I quoted budgetary costs for the bill of materials and man hours while creating an example timeline for the execution of the research effort.           </p>

          This research project was part of my undergraduate mechatronics course at Florida State University. In this project the team was responsible for creating a protype of a submersible vehicle to demonstrate sensor integration and remote control. In this project I was responsible for developing the guidance system for the submersible, essentially focusing on the rear half of the vehicle. I developed a tethered motor controller to manually guide the vehicle using two rear motors. This system required designing IP65 proof seals around the output shafts to prevent water ingress.          </p>

The static pressure of the water affects the dynamic pressure of the cavity which I measured the sum of at the pressure sensor diaphragm.           </p>
