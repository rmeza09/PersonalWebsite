          <h2>Portland, Oregon - 2024</h2>
          <p>
            In November 2024, I had the incredible opportunity to attend and present a poster on my research at the ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress in Portland, Oregon. Over three enriching days, I learned about state-of-the-art research, connected with fellow engineers, and engaged in discussions on the future of fiber optic health monitoring systems for structural state evaluation.
